# InnovateATL Hackathon

Welcome to the InnovateATL Hackathon! This event aims to bring together talented engineers, public sector experts, and the local tech community to develop innovative solutions for Atlanta's most pressing public sector challenges.

## Objectives

- **Harness Cutting-Edge AI:** Utilize state-of-the-art LLMs to build creative solutions addressing Atlanta's pressing issues.
- **Public Sector Collaboration:** Foster collaboration between engineers and public sector experts for impactful, practical solutions.
- **Community Engagement:** Engage the local tech community to support public welfare through technology.
- **Solution Implementation:** Develop practical prototypes that can be piloted and implemented by the city's departments.

## Problem Statements

Participants can choose from one of the following key challenges or propose their own issue related to the public sector in Atlanta:

### Improving Public Transportation
**Problem:** Enhance communication and service accessibility for MARTA (Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority).
- **Solution Examples:** AI-powered chatbots for real-time customer support, natural language-based trip planning, and feedback systems.

### Enhancing Emergency Services Communication
**Problem:** Optimize communication between emergency responders and the public.
- **Solution Examples:** LLM-driven public alerts system, predictive emergency response models using public data, and advanced disaster communication platforms.

### Streamlining City Administration
**Problem:** Improve citizen engagement and streamline administrative processes.
- **Solution Examples:** Automated FAQs and chatbot assistants for city departments, paperwork simplification using NLP, and real-time feedback mechanisms.

### Facilitating Homeless Support Services
**Problem:** Coordinate support services for the homeless population.
- **Solution Examples:** NLP-enabled data collection for service needs, automated resource directories, and LLM-assisted case management.

### Promoting Transparency in Local Governance
**Problem:** Enhance transparency and citizen participation in local government decisions.
- **Solution Examples:** NLP-based analysis of public documents, citizen-friendly government portals, and automated policy brief generation.

## Example Project

### 311+
Users can take a photo of a car break-in incident, and the tool automatically inputs a 311 report, using metadata from the photo to identify the location and time. "311+" fills out the necessary form, making it easier for victims to report incidents quickly and accurately.
